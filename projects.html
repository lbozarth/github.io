<h3>Social Movement Organizations in Online Movements</h3>
<p>We build nested supervised learning models and identify more than 50 thousand social movement organizations (SMO) participating in 2 distinct movements on Twitter. We analyze SMOs' role from five different perspectives: commitment, knowledge sharing, community-building, network structural significance, and recruitment. This project is currently under review. <a href="{{site.url}}/assets/static/smo.pdf">Download</a></p>

<h3>Slacktivist Contribution to Social Media Activism</h3>
<p>We measure the value of slacktivists involved in more than 80 protest movement hashtags on Twitter, focusing on their value for content generation, communication, encouragement, and content diversity. Further, we move beyond the existing literature which primarily focuses on direct content contributions by investigating whether slacktivists induce further contributions from other activists by providing them simple cues of encouragement that enhance non-slacktivists' commitment to a movement. This project was published in ICWSM2017. <a href="{{site.url}}/assets/static/slack.pdf">Download</a></p>
