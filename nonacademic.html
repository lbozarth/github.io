<p>-- I solo traveled around the world for half a year: hitchhiked in Japan because transportation cost was outrageous (picture is the hitchhike sign I sketched); took a 2-week Thai Massage course in Chiang Mai; biked 1000+ km around the entire island of Taiwan; stayed with a family of native Mongolians, painted goats and rode horses with them; took a 7 day Trans-Siberian train from Ulan-Ude to Moscow; solo hiked alongside Loch Ness (the Great Glen Way) for over a week in Scotland.</p>
